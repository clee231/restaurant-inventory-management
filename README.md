> "Your software firm, ACME Hacking, Inc. has been approached by the owner of 
Wolfgang Buck, a famous restaurant in the area. The restaurant has been quite 
successful, so successful that the current system of maintaining inventory of 
ingredients for dishes to be served at the restaurant has become inadequate. 
Every morning an employee checks all the available inventory and writes a 
shopping list using a word processor. Next, the employee prints the shopping 
list and goes to various food stores in order to buy needed ingredients. 
However, the employee sometimes "forgets" to check certain ingredients, meaning
that the dishes using those ingredients cannot be served. In other cases, 
ingredients thought to be available are in fact spoiled, meaning that they 
cannot be used for dish preparation. Finally, sometimes the employee 
overestimates the amount of ingredients needed for a dish, resulting in wasted 
food. Wolfgang would like to have an inventory management system, keeping track
of foods in the restaurant and generating appropriate shopping lists at the 
beginning of each day. The system knows when foods are purchased and when they 
will spoil. In addition, the system can infer when ingredients will be needed 
based on dishes that were served the previous day."
